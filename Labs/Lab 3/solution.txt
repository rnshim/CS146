Problem 1:
1. n^3/100000000000n^2 > 1000000000000n^2/n^3
so n^3
2. (n^2)logn/n(log(n))10>n(log(n))10/(n^2)logn
so (n^2)logn
3. logn(logn) vs sqrt(n)log2
log(logn)^2 vs  log(sqrt(n)log2)
2log(logn) vs log(sqrt(n))+loglog2
2^sqrt(n)
4. 2n>n
2^2n

Problem 2:
1. Best Case:
if n is even
n%x is evaluated to 0 on the first loop iteration,
so O(1)

2. Worst Case:
entire for loop is executed without exiting,
so O(sqrt(n))

3. Average Case:
O(sqrt(n)) or O(n)
